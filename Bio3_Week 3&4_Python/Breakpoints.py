Find the number of breakpoints in a permutation.
     Input: A permutation.
     Output: The number of breakpoints in this permutation.

Sample Input:
(+3 +4 +5 -12 -8 -7 -6 +1 +2 +10 +9 -11 +13 +14)
Sample Output:
8

Consecutive elements (pi pi+1) in permutation P = (p1 ... pn) form an adjacency if pi+1 − pi is equal to 1. By definition, for any 
positive element k < n, both (k k + 1) and (−(k + 1) −k) are adjacencies. If pi+1 − pi is not equal to 1, then we say that (pi pi+1) 
is a breakpoint.
Because any pair of consecutive elements of a permutation form either a breakpoint or adjacency, we have the following identity for 
any permutation P of length n:

    Adjacencies(P) + Breakpoints(P) = n + 1

This formula implies that a permutation on n elements may have at most n + 1 adjacencies.
